# Arena-internship
week 1 task
in this first task i came to know about what is python and why it is used 
how to use the variables and print the data 
Project Overview and Objectives
 Overview
This project is a simple Python console-based program that collects basic user information and displays a friendly welcome message. The program interacts with the user using input and output statements.
🎯 Objectives
•	To understand how to take user input in Python
•	To learn how to store input data using variables
•	To display formatted and friendly output using print()
•	To build confidence in writing basic Python programs
Brief Explanation of What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
•	How to use the input() function to accept data from users
•	How to store user inputs in variables
•	How to display user-friendly messages using print()
•	How a simple Python program executes step by step
•	Basic documentation structure for a programming project

Setup and Installation Instructions
🔧 Requirements
•	Python version 3.8 or above
🛠 Installation Steps
1.	Install Python from the official website
2.	Open any code editor (VS Code / PyCharm / IDLE)
3.	Create a Python file named:
4.	welcome.py
5.	Write the program code
6.	Run the file using:
7.	python welcome.py

Code Structure Explanation
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
place = input("Where are u from? ")

print("\nhey! Welcome ")
print("Hello", name + "!")
print("You are", age, "years old.")
print("so you are from", place + "!")
print("it's my pleasure to meet you! ")

 Explanation:
•	input() → Takes information from the user
•	Variables (name, age, hobby) → Store user responses
•	print() → Displays a welcoming message
•	\n → Adds a new line for better formatting
Screenshots of Working Application
📸 Screenshot 1: Program asking user input
📸 Screenshot 2: Output displaying friendly welcome message
Explanation of How Technical Requirements Were Met
Requirement	How It Was Met
Use input()	Used to ask name, age, and hobby
Use variables	Stored input in name, age, hobby
Use print()	Displayed welcome message
Minimum 3 questions	Asked 3 user questions
Friendly output	Used emojis and positive language
	
Key Requirements (Completed ✅)
•	✅ Use input() to get user information
•	✅ Use variables to store the answers
•	✅ Use print() to display the welcome message
•	✅ Asked at least 3 questions
•	✅ Output is friendly and welcoming

 Conclusion
This project helped me understand the basics of user interaction in Python. It strengthened my fundamentals and introduced me to writing proper documentation, which is important for real-world software development.
